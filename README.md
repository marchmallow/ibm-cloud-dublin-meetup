Meetup link: <https://www.meetup.com/IBM-Cloud-Dublin>

### Meetup April 30, 2019

In this meetup we'll demonstrate how we can deploy and run a set of sample microservices on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) and how these services can interact with other IBM Cloud services like IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL and Redis, and IBM Cloud Object Storage. We'll also show an example of logging and monitoring of the microservices running on IKS using IBM Cloud Logging with LogDNA and IBM Cloud Monitoring with SysDig service.
